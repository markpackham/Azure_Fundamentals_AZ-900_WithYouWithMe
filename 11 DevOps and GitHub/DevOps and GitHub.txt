DevOps and GitHub


GitHub is arguably the world's most popular code repository for open-source software. Git is a decentralised source-code management tool commonly used in extensive IT and tech firms.

Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018 Microsoft uses GitHub extensively themselves.
An accessible, open-source repository for your code and is excellent for versioning code and collaboration.


GitHub Actions enables workflow automation with triggers for many lifecycle events. 

One such example would be automating a CI/CD (or continuous development/continuous deployment) toolchain. A toolchain is a combination of software tools that aid in delivering, developing and managing software applications throughout a system's development life cycle. The output of one device in the toolchain is the input of the following tool in the toolchain. Typical tool functions include performing automated dependency updates to building and configuring the software, delivering the build artefacts to various locations, testing, etc.


DevOps

Azure DevOps Services is a service suite that addresses every stage of the software development lifecycle. It has several functions listed below.

Azure Repos is a centralised source-code repository where software development, DevOps engineering, and documentation professionals can publish their code for review and collaboration.
Azure Boards is an agile project management suite that includes Kanban boards, reporting, and tracking ideas and work from high-level epics to work items and issues.
Azure Pipelines is a CI/CD pipeline automation tool.
Azure Artefacts is a repository for hosting artefacts, such as compiling source code, which can be fed into testing or deployment pipeline steps.
Azure Test Plans is an automated test tool that can be used in a CI/CD pipeline to ensure quality before a software release.


Azure DevTest Labs

Azure DevTest Labs provides an automated means of managing the process of building, setting up, and tearing down virtual machines (VMs) and anything you can provision with an ARM template that contains builds of your software projects.

Developers and testers can perform tests across a variety of environments and builds.
Capability isn't limited to VMs. Anything you can deploy in Azure via an ARM template can be provisioned through Dev Test Labs.
Provisioning pre-created lab environments with required configurations and tools is a huge time saver for quality assurance professionals and developers.


Summary

In this lesson we went through some of the services and tool available to manage projects of various types. The main points to remember are:

1 GitHub is an open-source code repository.

2 GitHub Actions enables workflow automation and is good for CI/CD.

3 DevOps is a suite of services that helps manage every stage of the development lifecycle. 

4 Dev Test Labs is a service used by developers and testers to help them test their projects. The ability to pre configure environments saves them a lot of time.
