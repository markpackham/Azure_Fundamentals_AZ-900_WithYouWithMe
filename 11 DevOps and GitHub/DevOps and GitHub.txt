A toolchain is a combination of software tools that aid in delivering, developing and managing software applications throughout a system's development life cycle. The output of one device in the toolchain is the input of the following tool in the toolchain. Typical tool functions include performing automated dependency updates to building and configuring the software, delivering the build artefacts to various locations, testing, etc.
