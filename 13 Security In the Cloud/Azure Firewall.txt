Azure Firewall

What is a Firewall

A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules. You can create firewall rules that specify ranges of IP addresses. Only clients granted IP addresses from within those ranges can access the destination server. Firewall rules can also include specific network protocol and port information.


Azure Firewall

Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that helps protect resources in your Azure virtual networks. A virtual network is similar to a traditional network that you'd operate in your data centre. It's a fundamental building block for your private network that enables virtual machines, and other compute resources to securely communicate with the internet and on-premises networks. 

Azure Firewall is a stateful firewall. A stateful firewall analyses the complete context of a network connection, not just an individual packet of network traffic. Azure Firewall features high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. Azure Firewall provides a central location to create, enforce, and log application and network connectivity policies across subscriptions and virtual networks. Azure Firewall uses a static (unchanging) public IP address for your virtual network resources, enabling outside firewalls to identify traffic coming from your virtual network. The service is integrated with Azure Monitor to enable logging and analytics. Azure Firewall provides many features, including:

 ● Built-in high availability. 

● Unrestricted cloud scalability. 

● Inbound and outbound filtering rules. 

● Inbound Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT) support. 

● Azure Monitor logging. You typically deploy Azure Firewall on a central virtual network to control general network access.
