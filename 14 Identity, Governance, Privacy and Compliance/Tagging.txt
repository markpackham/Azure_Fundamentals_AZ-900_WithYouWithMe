Governance - Tagging

Tags

As an organisation, it becomes complex to manage resources and monitor costs because it is larger and utilises more cloud resources. You already know that you can manage by subscription and resource groups, but another way is by resource tags. Tags are extra information or metadata about resources.


Benefits of resource tags
–
* Resource management: enabling you to locate and act on resources that are associated with specific workloads, environments, business units, and owners
* Cost management and optimisation: enabling you to group resources so that you can report on costs, allocate internal cost centres, track budgets, and forecast costs
* Operations management: enabling you to group resources according to how critical their availability is to the organisation. This helps formulate service-level agreements (SLAs)
* Security: enabling you to classify data by its security level, such as public or confidential
* Governance and regulatory compliance: enabling you to identify resources that have governance or regulatory compliance requirements and also internal standards such as an owner or department name
* Workload optimisation and automation: can help you capture and visualise all the resources required in a complex deployment.


Managing resource tags
–
Can be added, modified, or deleted by:

Powershell
Azure CLI
Azure Resource Manager templates
the REST API
Azure Portal
Azure Policy


Resource tags and Azure Policy
–
Azure Policy can:

apply tags to a resource group (not automatically applied to resources)
ensure a resource inherits the same tags as the parent resource group
enforce tagging rules and conventions (require certain tags to be added to new resources as they are established or have a rule that reapplies a tag if it has been removed from a resource)


If required, you can run queries, for example, from PowerShell or the Azure CLI, to list all resources that contain these tags. Remember that you don't need to enforce that a specific tag is present on all of your resources. For example, you might decide that only mission-critical resources have the Impact tag, which means that all non-tagged resources would not be considered mission-critical.
