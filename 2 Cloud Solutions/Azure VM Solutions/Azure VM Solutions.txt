Azure VM Solutions


Scaling VMs in the Cloud

It's no surprise that when it comes to configuring your VM solution to be able to scale, Azure, AWS and Google all provide extremely robust and simple to execute services to cater for this need.

Increase the overall 'uptime' (availability) of your server
Ensure you are only paying for the additional resources when you need it
