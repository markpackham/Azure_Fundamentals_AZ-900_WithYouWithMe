Cloud Networking Services

Networking in the Cloud

Just like the compute service, the networking service is one which underpins nearly every other cloud service. 

Virtual networks are essential in providing the communication link between the cloud services and tools you provision and consume, so having an understanding of some of the basics will be essential, especially when it comes to troubleshooting.

Some of these network services are 'hidden', or abstracted into other services, and depending on the service you consume, and while you might not need to make any networking configuration changes, it's still important to know what they do at a high-level.


Azure virtual networks (VNet) enable Azure resources - such as virtual machines, web apps, and databases - to connect and communicate via a virtual link. 

That communication link can be configured to keep your resources isolated in the cloud, or you can configure it to connect to physical datacenters for your corporate office(s)


What capablilities does Azure virtual networking provide?

Just like a physical network, which is typically managed and configured through a router or firewall in a datacenter, virtual networks provides alsmost the same functionality and capabilities, and sometimes more!

With Azure, the virtual network service provides the following capabilities:

Network isolation and segmentation

Internet communications

Communicate between Azure resources

Communicate with on-premises resources

Route network traffic

Filter network traffic

Connect virtual networks
